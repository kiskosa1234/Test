I knew my rent was gon' be late about a week ago
I worked my ass off
But I still can't pay it though
But I got just enough
To get off in this club
Have me a good time, before my time is up
Hey, let's get it now

Ooh, I want the time of my life, yeah (Mr. Worldwide)
Oh, baby
Ooh, give me the time of my life, hey hey hey (Ne-Yo, let's get it)
Let's get it now
