I knew my rent was gon' be late about a week ago
I worked my ass off
But I still can't pay it though
But I got just enough
To get off in this club
Have me a good time, before my time is up
Hey, let's get it now

Ooh, I want the time of my life, yeah (Mr. Worldwide)
Oh, baby
Ooh, give me the time of my life, hey hey hey (Ne-Yo, let's get it)
Let's get it now


This the last twenty dollars I got
But I'ma have a good time ballin' tonight
Tell the bartender "line up some shots"
'Cause I'ma get loose tonight
She's on fire, she's so hot
I'm no liar, she burned up the spot
Look like Mariah, I took another shot
Told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot
Dirty talk, dirty dance
She a freaky girl and I'm a freaky man
She on the rebound, broke up with her ex
And now I'm like Rodman, ready on deck
I told her, "Wanna ride out?" and she said "Yes"
We didn't go to church, but I got blessed
